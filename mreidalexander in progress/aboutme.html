Originally from Louisiana, I am a web designer in houston texas. I have a passion for 
technology and a strong desire to learn. My professional background and strengths lie
in marketing and advertising.

i was drawn to web desing and programming by my realization that there is a growing need 
for technology integration in businesses no matter the size. 

my specialization is finding the right strategy for integrating technology into a business
model based on individual needs. </p>
