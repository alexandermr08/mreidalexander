		<p>
Originally from Louisiana, I am a self-taught web designer in Tyler, Texas. I have a passion for 
technology and a strong desire to learn. My professional background and strengths lie
in marketing and advertising.

I was drawn to web design and programming by its diverse requirements. I enjoy taking on new challenges
and finding creative solutions to new problems.

My specialization is finding the right strategy for integrating technology into a business
model based on individual needs. <br><br>

I am a sports fanatic, outdoor lover, and a sucker for a great craft brew! When I'm not coding, I can be 
found running with my dog Lola, searching the internet for random knowledge(the more obscure the better), 
or looking for something to fix.<br><br>
