		 <h1>The inspiration...</h1>
		 <p><i>	As long as I can remember I have known I wanted to be an entrepreneur. To be involved
			in something from its conception and to mold the way a company conducts business is 
			my dream.</p> 
		<p>	As a result, I have spent a fair amount of time researching the necessary skills to be
			successful as an entrepreneur. One day I stumbled across an article mentioning the benefit
			of knowing how to code for young entrepreneurs and it was like a light bulb came on in my 
			head. This was something I could use to make my dream a reality...</i></p>
